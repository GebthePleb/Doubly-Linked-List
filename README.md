# Doubly-Linked-List
A look into the linked list data structure!

DoublyLinkedList.java: 
This the actualy bulk of the project and the data structure I was implementing. 

ListDriver.java:
This is a file that is the main/driver for the program that puts data into the list to be used.

Movie.java:
is a simply user defined objects class used to demostrate the generic nature of the linked list
